1.1	Title & Objective of the study  

‘IPL SCORE PREDICTION PROJECT’ is the project we are working upon which falls under the IPL(Indian premier league)  T-20 . It contains all the data from regarding venues, teams, wickets, runs etc…. through 2008-2020. The primary purpose of working on this project is to predict the score based on the actual, whether the actual and the predicted were similar or not by training the past data. In simple terms, regression is a technique used to predict the unknown value of an object, using the characteristics of the object and by having some information about other similar objects for which we know the value.
 
1.2 Need of the Study 
In this project, the main purpose is to predict the score ,by using the past data and which algorithms predicts well and This algorithm then outputs the winner of two teams using the team rating points that the machine learning algorithm had predicted. Given the player statistics to a machine learning model, the model outputs the rating points for that player based on his statistics. In the final stage, we are left with top two teams. We call the algorithm for one last time and it outputs the Final Winner
